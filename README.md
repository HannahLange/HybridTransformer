### Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems

Transformer quantum state implentation for the dipolar XY model, which can be pretrained using numerical data or experimental data, e.g. from quantum simulators as in Ref.  [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05859-2).
